Hii Build00rs  üëãüèª

I am [Irfan](https://twitter.com/irffanasiff). I along with my friend [Jay](https://twitter.com/mewtyunjay) built this plugin. We named it [Snappy](https://snappy-plugin.com).

**Features:**

- Generate Images from **text**.
- **Customizing** different fields gives more control on generated images and more customization such as Style Modifiers and Prompt enhancer on the way.
- Use **reference images / ruff sketches** to get better images out of them.
- Explore images from lexica, use them in figma or see them for inspiration and prompt ideas.
- A prompt guide and also we are adding prompt engineering to help users write better prompts.
- Generate multiple images in a single click. Render them inside different shapes in figma directly.

**Next:**

- [x]  Auth implementation
- [ ]  Payment Integration
- [x]  Working on reducing image load time in general.
- [ ]  Less loading time for generating next image using smart queue with keyboard shortcut

We are also working on a **smart queue** feature where in the load time for generating next image is drastically reduced if the user is not satisfied with the current generation and wants another one.

- [ ]  Talk to users/companies for more features + feedback
